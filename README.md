# three.js WebGL & YouTube video overlay experiment

David Bayliss 2017 Feb / Mar

See https://blog.xarta.co.uk/contact for working example

Dependencies include:
* https://github.com/davros1973/tunnelgl (not yet working in IE)
* js: src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/threejs/r83/three.min.js"

Also some CSS and a font I put together for the contact list at the end.


Issues:
- only works "well" in Chrome, but still GL related errors reported in console
- Firefox has an issue with 3drotate (in JQuery)
- Internet Explorer doesn't like the tunnelgl iframe
- Edge works but needs more horsepower (struggles on a circa 2009 Core 2 Duo laptop)


ToDo (might add-to as I remember)
* start using git issues rather than README.md like this for them
* do something fun where I pause at the end of my street
* look at lighting and better camera control ... e.g. avoid flying through the Borg Cube
* generally improve my JavaScript
* and tackle issues listed above.


Will make more notes at:
